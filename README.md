# Fluid Friction Coefficient Plotter
<sup>*Undergrad project (2017)*</sup>

This program calculates the friction coefficient of a fluid in a pipe using the Colebrook-White equation.

The user inputs a range of pipe diameters and fluid proprties.
The program outputs a plot of the friction coefficient in relation to the pipe diameter, for the fluid properties given.
The program can also save up to 5 data sets, and import saved data for plotting.
